<p>
I am (at the time of writing this) in my second year at the University of Bristol, studying Mathematics. I'm particularly interested in weird maths problems that have unexpected outcomes, which is mainly what I blog about here, as well as the really satisfying nice links you get between different branches of mathematics, like matricies being really important in graph theory, and basically every branch of mathematics is used in machine learning, from calculus, to statistics, to game theory!

Not only do I love maths, I really like computer science too, and enjoy programming in my free time. I know python, R, and a little bit of javascript and C++, and made this website when I was bored. I hope you'll find something interesting on here!

Thanks to Sol, Jacob, and Zac for helping me make this website.
